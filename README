Unpack is a generic unpacking tool. Based on the file paths, it attempts to find
an acceptable top level directory to extract to.

This script primarily exists because not everyone sticks to the convention of
creating archives with a base folder, and the myriad of compression tools lack
a standard interface (and reading man pages is a chore).


Currently supported formats:
- tar (plus any compression supported by tar)
- 7z
- rar
- zip


Dependencies:
- p7zip 9.x (with rar support)
- A recent unzip and tar


The code is available under the BSD license.
