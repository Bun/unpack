There's still a lot to be done to make unpack actually good.

- Option to unpack single file to current directory
- Parameter for top directory override
- Optionally delete (after verify) archive?
- Might not always work with archives starting with `-'
- Make extracting non-verbose unless user wants it to be
- To avoid dealing with all the retarded listing formats, maybe just unpack to a
  temporary directory and then move based on file contents.


Future:
- File name encodings
